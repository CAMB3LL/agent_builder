Focus on separating concerns further by creating distinct classes or modules for each server type, ensuring that each class encapsulates its own validation and serialization logic. Additionally, implement a more robust error handling mechanism that provides clearer feedback to users when invalid configurations are encountered. Finally, consider adding type hints and improving the overall code documentation to facilitate easier understanding and future contributions.'\n",
